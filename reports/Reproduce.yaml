### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clone the Snap and install dependencies.
2. Observe `axios@0.27.2` in the `package-lock.json`.
3. Trigger a Snap call that relies on user input for URL/path.
4. Insert payload like `http://localhost:8000/internal-api` in Snap request.
5. Monitor outbound traffic (Burp, tcpdump) to confirm SSRF hit.

## 🧱 Remediation Advice
